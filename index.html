    <h2>Ajay Singh Kharb: Master Mentor & Expert Guide for Government Teaching Exams</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Ajay Singh Kharb is a Teacher Trainer & Mentor with 10+ years of experience. Every student aspires to study under him due to his unique Teaching style. He has cracked many government job exams such as DSSSB PRT, DSSSB EVGC Counsellor (PGT level), KVS PRT, CTET & many TET Exams. He did not pursue his job as he found that most of the students want to crack govt. job exams but are unable to do so due to lack of timely support, guidance, and quality education atmosphere. Therefore, he wanted to help & guide each student to turn their dreams into reality through his authentic and reliable support. Thousands of his students are employed at central as well as state level govt. jobs. (DSSSB Delhi, KVS, NVS, AEES, EMRS, NCERT, Chandigarh, Rajasthan, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, UGC NET (Assistant Professor) etc.)  He has done extensive work on mental health and wellbeing and conducts seminars for Teachers of Delhi Government(SCERT). His counselling sessions have helped many individuals to lead life with confidence & adopt a positive approach towards it.</p>

    <h2>Why The Teacher? Your Pathway to Government Teaching Jobs</h2>
    <br>
    <p>I Personally believe and found during my Teaching Experience that most of the students are unable to fulfill their dream of becoming a teacher due to lack of Right & Timely guidance, incomplete information etc. But they have the potential to become Great Teachers provided they have access to the above said. In view of the above I founded The Teacher to help all students in the best possible manner. The Teacher is a Platform through which every student will have access to reliable & authentic information related to all Teaching Exams. </p>
